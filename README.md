By this project you create a contract for selling your media and set contribution for anyone that work with you in that. Payment for contributer would be per their contribution and every contributer  can just withdraw its portion.
* 3 percent of any  buying payment of NFT send to marketplace account. 
* Marketplace account has the right of the contracts in other word for transferring your NFT you must take action from marketplace smartcontract.
* The main problem in  CopyrightManagment system is prevent people from coping files. We will work more in this section.
